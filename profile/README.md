# About

We are a consulting group on a mission to accelerate life sciences research with agentic systems.
We believe accessible intelligence will hugely benefit the life sciences and are helping biotech groups build agents for complex scientific tasks.

Our current focus is a collaboration with researchers at CU Denver Anschutz to build an agentic system to nominate compounds that hold promise for reversing cardiac fibrosis.
These compounds will then be screened in vitro and in vivo and used to inform the system during future nominations.
See the demo at [github.com/FibrolytixBio/cf-compound-selection-demo/](https://github.com/FibrolytixBio/cf-compound-selection-demo/tree/main).
